                                        Clean energy sources are types of energy
                                        that do not release harmful emissions or
                                        pollutants, such as greenhouse gases,
                                        sulfur dioxide, or nitrogen oxides.
                                        These types of energy are also referred
                                        to as renewable energy, as they are
                                        naturally replenished and don't use up
                                        natural resources.

                                        As the impact of climate change becomes
                                        increasingly concerning, the adoption of
                                        clean energy has become crucial to
                                        reduce greenhouse gas emissions. The

                                        Change (IPCC) recommends that a shift
                                        towards renewable energy sources is
                                        necessary to limit global warming to
                                        1.5°C above pre-industrial levels and
                                        prevent the most severe impacts of

                                        Iceland has virtually eliminated the use
                                        of fossil fuels and generates nearly
                                        100% of its electricity from renewable
                                        sources, primarily geothermal and
                                        hydropower. The country has also become
                                        a leader in the production of green
                                        hydrogen, a promising fuel source for
                                        the future.
