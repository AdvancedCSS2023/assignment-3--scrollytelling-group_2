## Which technology is used

Just like our previous assignment, we utilized a range of technologies to deliver a seamless user experience. One of the core technologies we used is HTML, which provided the foundation for the markup and structure of the web page. With HTML, we structured and organized the content in a logical and intuitive manner, resulting in an easy-to-use interface for the users.

In addition to HTML, we made extensive use of SCSS, a powerful preprocessor for CSS that allowed us to write more efficient and organized code. SCSS extended the functionality of CSS, enabling us to write complex styles and maintain consistency across the entire web page. By leveraging SCSS, we wrote cleaner, more modular code that was easier to read, maintain, and update. We also implemented the separation of concerns principle, which involved separating the CSS into reusable and manageable components. This allowed us to have a more scalable and maintainable codebase.

To streamline our development process, we implemented BEM (Block, Element, Modifier), a naming convention that made CSS classes more descriptive and easier to understand. BEM provided us with a clear and consistent way of naming and organizing CSS classes, which made it easier to create and manage complex styles across the entire web page.

Furthermore, we utilized Live Sass Compiler, an extension that compiled our SCSS code into CSS in real-time. With this tool, we were able to make changes to our SCSS code and instantly see the results without the need for manual compilation. By leveraging Live Sass Compiler, we were able to work more efficiently and productively.

By combining the power of these technologies, we delivered a well-structured, maintainable, and highly functional web page that provided users with a seamless and intuitive experience. Our use of HTML, SCSS with separation of concerns, BEM, and Live Sass Compiler enabled us to work efficiently and effectively to deliver a high-quality product that met the needs of our users.

## Who maintains and contributes to the project

Our project is being developed by a collaborative team of three individuals: Edgar, Christopher, and Snizhana. We are collectively responsible for maintaining and contributing to the project, and we believe that effective communication and responsibilities are essential to its success.

To ensure that we maintain a cohesive and coordinated approach to our work, we hold regular team meetings to review progress and discuss any issues that arise. These meetings serve as an opportunity to brainstorm new ideas, collaborate on features or enhancements, and ensure that our work is aligned with the project's goals and objectives.

As a team, we are committed to leveraging our individual strengths and areas of expertise to deliver a high-quality product that meets the needs of our user/users. By establishing clear roles and responsibilities and maintaining open lines of communication, we believe that we can work together effectively to ensure the success of our project. We are confident that our team's dedication and collaborative efforts will lead to a successful outcome.
